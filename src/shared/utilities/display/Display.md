## Display utilities

Gives the set display properties on certain elements. Eg: hiding input fields in form submits.

**NB:** Be careful not to use these helpers in reusable components, as it will be difficult to apply style changes to all components at a later point.

```code
[Display none]            .hw-display-none
```
