> [**Hedwig**](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hedwig) was Harry Potter's pet. Owls are used by wizards to deliver mail, but Hedwig was also an important companion as Harry was initiated into the wizarding world.

Hedwig is also Posten and Brings Front-End Style Guide.

# Getting started

Using Hedwig in your project is super simple. You only need to include the following..

In the document `head`:
```
[Fonts]    https://bring-hedwig.s3.amazonaws.com/hedwig/assets/fonts/fonts.css
[CSS]      https://bring-hedwig.s3.amazonaws.com/hedwig/releases/{posten/bring}-{version}.css
[JS]       https://bring-hedwig.s3.amazonaws.com/hedwig/releases/main-{version}.js
```

Before closing `body` tag:
```
[Icons]    https://bring-hedwig.s3.amazonaws.com/hedwig/icons.js
```

Important: To allow for the interactive UI components to gracefully degrade you should also add a `no-js` class to the `<html>` container of the site.

**WTF!? I do not want to include external files in my project.**
So. We want it to be super simple to use Hedwing. The files are lightweight (CSS 55KB, JS 16KB). This will not do much with your perfomance budget. So we prefer not to put it into your gulp-wepback-whatever build pipeline. 👍

## What Is a Front-End Style Guide?
> Front-end style guides are a modular collection of all the elements in your product’s user interface, together with code snippets for developers to copy and paste as needed to implement those elements. They include common UI components like buttons, form-input elements, navigation menus, modal overlays, and icons. **Lean UX (Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden)**

A front-end style guide is both a deliverable created by the design team, a developing tool and a tool used by the entire team for maintaining consistent, nimble product design in a modular format.

## Guidelines

- All components should do one thing, and do that thing well.
- All CSS should be written to adhere to the BEM methology.
- All JS should be classless and use `data-attributes` to attach functionality.
- New functionality should be reviewed by at least one other person before going into Hedwig.

## Contributing
All right, you need to change or add something. What do you do?

  1: If the thing you're changing or adding is specific to your project, and not all sites using Hedwig, use a separate css file to add or override functionality using your own classes and components.

  2: If you're adding new functionality to Hedwig, follow the below development guide.
  
  3: If you've found a bug, follow the below "Found a bug?" guide.

## Development
To develop on the project, please first read our guidelines and the contributing section above.

To add a new feature:
- Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b branchname`)
- Develop the new feature (Template css and js files can be found in the `/templates` folder)
- Document and test the new feature
- Create a pull request and ask for a review

To modify an existing feature follow the same process, but also remember the versioning system. If there is a breaking change, or if this might impact existing sites using hedwig, update the version number. See below for details.

## Versioning

Hedwig uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) to make sure once a site starts using it, the CSS file won't suddenly change and break the site. The version number is located in `package.json`, and will be appended to the `.css` and `.js` files. Example - `bring-1.0.3.css`.

When a breaking change is added, a new major version is required.

## Adding icons
To add a new icon:
- Generate your icon as an `.svg` file and place it in the `/build/assets/icons` folder.
- Run the `npm run svg` script. This will optimise the icon and generate an updated icon sprite sheet.
- Upload the new icons to s3 with `npm run s3:upload`.

## Found a bug?
- If you've found a bug, you can create a new [issue](https://github.com/bring/hedwig/issues) via github. 
- If you want to fix this issue yourself, do so and then follow the development guide above.
