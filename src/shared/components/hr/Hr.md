# Design guidelines

> HR is a horizontal rule used to separate content horizontally within a page or section.


### HR Styles

```image
plain: true
span: 3
src: "{assets}/img/{postenbring}/hr-styles-1.png"
title: "Normal"
description: "Our main HR is light grey on white background. Always use this version for backgrounds in white colour."
```
```image
plain: true
span: 3
src: "{assets}/img/{postenbring}/hr-styles-2.png"
title: "Dark backgrounds"
description: "When HR are used on dark backgrounds, e.g. the footer, the HR appear in the dark green colour."
```



## Best practices

#### Do

```image
plain: true
span: 3
src: "{assets}/img/{postenbring}/hr-do-1.png"
description: "HR should always be 100 % wide relative to its parent container."
```

#### Don't
  
```image
plain: true
span: 3
src: "{assets}/img/{postenbring}/hr-dont-1.png"
description: "HR should not be used as a decorative element, and never separate content within the same section."
```

```image
plain: true
span: 3
src: "{assets}/img/{postenbring}/hr-dont-2.png"
description: "Never use other-coloured HRs on backgrounds they were not intended to be used on."
```
