# Design guidelines

> Banners are prominent messages displayed full-width at the top of the page, below the navbar. Banners are used in case of emergency or special circumstances to inform about an event or situation that has occured.



### Banner types
```image
plain: true
span: 3
src: "{assets}/img/docs/{postenbring}/banner-types-1.png"
title: "Expand"
description: "This banner shows a one-line heading by default, and expands when clicked, showing a short paragraph with information of the occurred event or subject. The expanded section can contain a link to a page for further reading."
```
```image
plain: true
span: 3
src: "{assets}/img/docs/{postenbring}/banner-types-2.png"
title: "No expand"
description: "This banner shows a short sentence of information on one line, with no option to expand. The banner can be static or contain links for further reading."
```


## Best practices

### Do

```image
plain: true
span: 3
src: "{assets}/img/docs/{postenbring}/banner-do-1.png"
description: "Do use a solid button for main option, and outlined buttons for other options."
```

### Don't
  
```image
plain: true
span: 3
src: "{assets}/img/docs/{postenbring}/banner-dont-1.png"
description: "Donâ€™t use multiple solid buttons together."
```
