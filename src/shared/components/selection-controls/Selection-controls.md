# Design guidelines

> Selection controls allow the user to select one or multiple options, and confirming choices and actions. Selection controls are used when users need to make decisions or declare preferences.




### Styles of selection controls
```image
plain: true
span: 2
src: "{assets}/img/{postenbring}/{component}-styles-1.png"
title: "Plain"
description: "Plain selection controls are used when it is a single or just a few options. The plain style integrates well with running text."
```
```image
plain: true
span: 2
src: "{assets}/img/{postenbring}/{component}-styles-2.png"
title: "With bounding box"
description: "Selection controls with bounding box are used when multiple options are listed together, to make them stand out more, like a button."
```





### Types of selection controls
```image
plain: true
span: 2
src: "{assets}/img/{postenbring}/{component}-types-1.png"
title: "Radio button"
description: "Radio buttons are used when the user can choose just a single option, and they are required to make a choice."
```
```image
plain: true
span: 2
src: "{assets}/img/{postenbring}/{component}-types-2.png"
title: "Checkbox"
description: "Checkboxes can both be optional and required, and the user can choose multiple options."
```
```image
plain: true
span: 2
src: "{assets}/img/{postenbring}/{component}-types-3.png"
title: "Fieldset"
description: "Fieldset is a predefined component of checkboxes put together. This can be used in Figma as it is, or as a base and make adjustments to your needs."
```








## Best practices

### Do

```image
plain: true
span: 3
src: "{assets}/img/{postenbring}/{component}-do-1.png"
description: "Use just one style; either plain or with bounding box, within the same instance."
```

### Don't
  
```image
plain: true
span: 3
src: "{assets}/img/{postenbring}/{component}-dont-1.png"
description: "Do not mix styles within an instance."
```
```image
plain: true
span: 3
src: "{assets}/img/{postenbring}/{component}-dont-2.png"
description: "Do not use checkboxes when just one option can be selected."
```
