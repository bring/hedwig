# Hedwig is Bring's design system

To use Hedwig in your project is super simple. You only need to include this in your document:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://some-cdn.com/hedwig/1.0.0/hedwig.min.css">
<script src="http://some-cdn.com/hedwig/1.0.0/hedwig.min.js"></script>
```

**WTF!? I do not want to include external files in my project.**
So. We want it to be super simple to use Hedwing in your project. The Hedwig files are super lightweight (CSS 000 kb, JS 000 kb). This will not do much with your perfomance budget. And is much simpler than getting it into your gulp-wepback-whatever build pipeline. üëç
