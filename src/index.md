> [**Hedwig**](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hedwig) was Harry Potter's pet. Owls are used by wizards to deliver mail, but Hedwig was also an important companion as Harry was initiated into the wizarding world.

Hedwig is also Posten and Brings Front-End Style Guide.

# Getting started

Using Hedwig in your project is super simple. You only need to include this:
```
Fonts: http://hedwig-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/hedwig/assets/fonts/fonts.css
CSS: http://hedwig-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/hedwig/main.css
JS: http://hedwig-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/hedwig/main.js
```

**WTF!? I do not want to include external files in my project.**
So. We want it to be super simple to use Hedwing. The files are lightweight (CSS 000 kb, JS 000 kb). This will not do much with your perfomance budget. So we prefer not to put it into your gulp-wepback-whatever build pipeline. 👍

## What Is a Front-End Style Guide?
> Front-end style guides are a modular collection of all the elements in your product’s user interface, together with code snippets for developers to copy and paste as needed to implement those elements. They include common UI components like buttons, form-input elements, navigation menus, modal overlays, and icons. **Lean UX (Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden)**

A front-end style guide is both a deliverable created by the design team, a developing tool and a tool used by the entire team for maintaining consistent, nimble product design in a modular format.
